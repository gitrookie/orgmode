* Interface
  In Object Oriented languages the term /interface/ is often used to define an
  abstract type that contains no data or code.but defines behavior as method
  signatures. A class having code and data for all the methods corresponding to
  that interface is said to implement that interface. Furthermore a class can
  implement different interfaces and hence can be of different types at the same
  time.
  An interface is hence a *type definition*;the type of object can be defined in
  terms of interface rather than specifying a particular class.
  The use of interface allow programming style called *programming to
  interface*;to base programming logic on the interfaces rather than internal
  implementation details. It makes code more reusable.
