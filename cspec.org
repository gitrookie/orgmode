* Concepts
** Indentifiers
   An indentifier can denote an object;a function;a tag or a member of
   structure;union or enumeration;a typedef name;a label name;a macro name; or a
   macro parameter.
*** Scope of identifiers
    The identifier is visible only within a region of program text called its
    scope. Different entities designated by same identifier either have
    different scope or in different namespaces. There are four different kind of
    scopes: function, file, block, /function prototype/.
