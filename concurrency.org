* Concurrency and Parallelism
  General Ideas
  Concurrency deals with managing access to shared state from different threads.
  Paralleism is about using multiple cores/processors to imporove the performance
  of the system.
** Message Passing
   The big idea is messaging - how models communicate not how models are
   internally represented.
** Event Loops
   Most Event Loops will block if there are no events ready, which means the
   operating system will not give the task any execution time until an event
   happens 
*** Event Generators
*** Event Dispatchers
*** Event Processors
