* Wire Level Protocol
  A wire level protocol can be thought of as the complement of an API. Instead
  of defining functions and creating libraries, you define the conversational
  byte sequence that pass over a network to make things happen.

  When a protocol is specified at the wire-level and published, most
  technologies can use it, or be made to use it. Compare this to an API, where
  the actual implementation is specific to the platform.
* System Calls
  Transfers control from an application to subsystems managed by kernel. Since
  those subsystems are shared by multiple processes one must cross boundary from
  user into kernel space in order to work with them.
