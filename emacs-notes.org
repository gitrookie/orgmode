* Common Lisp in Emacs
  In gnu Emacs to use common lisp features. The following example shows common
  lisp usage

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require `cl)
    (setq animal-names `(lion tiger sheep))
    (loop for pkg in animal-names
          do (print pkg))
  #+END_SRC
* Property Lists
  A ~property list~ or ~plist~ is a list of paired elements. Each of the pair
  associates a property name with a property name (usually a symbol) with a
  property or value. Below is an example of property list
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (pine cones numbers (1 2 3) color "blue")
  #+END_SRC
  The property name and values can be any lisp objects but names are usually
  symbols.
